# Introduction

For our semester long project, we want to develop a platformer that has some bullet hell elements, and we also want the character to have unique movement abilities and transform to acquire different powers in a fantasy forest setting. We plan on adding a stamina bar for the character to limit their usage of the double jump and dash abilities. We also want the characters to transform and be able to gain the ability to fly or gain other attacking abilities.

In this project, we plan on developing one level that gets progressively harder as time goes on, and presents features as moving platforms, death pits, ladders, and vines. We also plan on implementing a timer that increases the difficulty by increasing the number of bullets that an ememy shoots, making it harder for the player to heal, and distorting the screen to encourage the player to quickly finish the level. For the level that we are developing, we plan for it to be 3-6 minutes long.

# Anticipated Technologies

We plan on using Unreal engine 5.3 and Itch.io assets to build this project.

# Method/Approach

We plan on using the GitHub message board to keep up to date with each other on the progress of the project by following the agile approach.

# Estimated Timeline

* Get the mechanics of the platformer working first by creating a platform and a basic character in **at least 1 week**.
* Get a working character that can double jump and dash with a stamina bar system in **at least 2 weeks**.
* Design working enemies that can shoot bullets, deal damage, and take damage in **at least 2 weeks**.
* Design cohesive level with many platformer aspects in **at least 2 weeks**.

# Anticipated Problems

* Schedule flexability.
* Time management with other classes.
* Collesion detection
* Enemy AI
* Character abilities
* Version control using GitHub
