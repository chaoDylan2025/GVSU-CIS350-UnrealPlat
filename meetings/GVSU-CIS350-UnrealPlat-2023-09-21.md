Team name: Unreal Plat

Members present: Dylan, Kelson, Huy

Date: 09/21/23

Time: 3:58 PM

Discussion points: 

* We were thinking about having a fantasy forest theme for the first level of the platformer.
* Some of the platform mechanics that we discussed about potentially adding are death pits, ladders/vines, and moving platforms.
* For the character mechanics, we are considering on adding double jump, dash, and a stamina bar to prevent the player from abusing the dash ability.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Each team member will gather assets that they can find and discuss about which assets can possibly be included in the game.
* Each team member will also find a plugin that allows unreal to use git properly.
* Each team member will learn about the basics on how to use unreal engine before starting the programming process.
